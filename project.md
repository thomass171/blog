This project started back in 2012 when I started figuring out the options
for creating 3D graphics. After realizing there is no native 3D support
in Java any more and playing around with WebGL and Javascript some time, 
I quickly came back to Java as my favorite programming language.

And with LWJGL I also found the way for 3D in Java. After first steps
on this low level and finding 3D engines like ThreeJs and JMonkeyEngine,
combined with the power of GWT, I focused on building a 3D graphics engine
wrapper in Java.

The first use case were mazes inspired by my first experience with
the dungeons of Wizardry.

Motivated by model railways like MiWuLa the idea of vehicles moving
on a graph arose, leading to a ground services plugin for Flightgear.

This idea later extended to complete landscape building based on
OSM data, but this is still in a draft stage.
