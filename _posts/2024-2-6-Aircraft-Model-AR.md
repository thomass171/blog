title: Place aircraft model on your desk using AR
---
Using the passthrough mode of the Meta Quest 3 augmented reality can be used. This example creates a 
'Cessna 172' aircraft model ahead of you. You can grab it and place it somewhere.

The model was created by the team of "https://flightgear.org" originally and than
converted from ac format to gltf format (causing some artifacts).

On the left VR controllers wrist there is a control panel. Pressing 'L' here loads a second model, a 'Boeing 777', that
was also created by Flightgear.
